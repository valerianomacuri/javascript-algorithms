 * key = 'ab'
 * bucketsNumber = 100
 * Output = 95 (which is (97 + 98) % 100, since ASCII for 'a' is 97 and for 'b' is 98)
 *
 * @param {string} key - Key value that needs to be hashed.
 * @param {number} bucketsNumber - The number of available buckets.
 * @return {number} - Bucket index that will store the value for specific key.
